This is a remake of this old-school retro offline multiplayer game created in Unity with C# scripts. Goal was to create school final project for C# .NET subject. Numerous things I did in an ugly way because of small amount of time and size of code requirements. However I did learn a lot by programming this so it would be much easier doing something similar next time. Game works fine. One day I'll maybe add online multiplayer and make some nice refactoring!
